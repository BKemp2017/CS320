## Explanation of Project one and two 

This repository contains files from Project One and Two, which showcase my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The files submitted from Project One include Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java. From Project Two, I have submitted the summary and reflections report.

These files demonstrate my ability to create unit tests using code to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements.

In addition to these files, I have reflected on the work I have done in these projects, as reflecting is a valuable skill to cement my learning and add context to refresh my memory when I use my portfolio in the future.

To ensure that code, program, or software is functional and secure, it is essential to implement software testing, automation, and quality assurance. Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that a software system meets its requirements and specifications. Automation helps to perform tests efficiently and consistently, and Quality assurance is an ongoing process that ensures that the software meets high standards. To ensure security, developers can implement various measures, such as encryption and access control, to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

Interpreting user needs is crucial when developing software, and it requires a comprehensive understanding of the target audience, their needs, and their preferences. Communication with stakeholders and gathering feedback is essential in this regard, and techniques such as surveys and interviews can be used to identify user requirements. Incorporating user needs into the program can be achieved through design thinking, user-centered design, and agile methodologies that involve iterative development and frequent user feedback.

Designing software involves a series of steps that include analyzing requirements, designing a system architecture, creating a detailed design, coding, testing, and maintenance. Approaches to software design include structured design, object-oriented design, and model-driven design. Choosing the appropriate approach depends on the system's complexity, scalability, maintainability, and other factors. Best practices for software design include creating a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture, using design patterns, and adhering to coding standards and guidelines.
